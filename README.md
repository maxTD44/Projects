Some of the work done at SD Learn bootcamp

Counter Tool

This tool has three unique counters which allow you to add or decrease by one. You can refresh each counter by clicking the Reset button. 

The Delete button currently has no functionality, though it was added with the intention of being able to add and delete entire counter rows. The total in the bottom is also just a placeholder, which would ultimately sum the values in each counter.

Do NOT Click

This take on the classic "Do Not Click" button that scolds you when you click it iterates through a series of comments before looping back to the beginning. Side divs (in blue) were used to ensure proper centering of the button on the page.

High Low Game

This complete game allows you to play a guessing game with the computer, which randomly chooses a number between 1 and 100 and compares your guess to it. You will lose if you don't correctly guess the number after 7 tries.

Looping Practice

This project taught me how to use Javascript loops.

Tic Tac Toe Game

This game makes use of alerts to take the user's name, alert the user's turn, and alert wins and ties. Further functionality would replace these alerts with changed text fields on the page, a score counter, and an option to play against the computer.

To Do List

This to do list uses bootstrap styling and three divs (which float for adjusted browser widths). Tasks are automatically added to the To Do category, and are moved to the Completed category on a button click. From either div, tasks can also be deleted.

Some practice with HTML and CSS work
